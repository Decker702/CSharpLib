               Postfix increment
                var a = 1;
                var b = a++;
                In this case a is 2 (increase by 1; 1+1=2) and b is 1 (original a value; 1)
                    This is because 1 is assigned to b before it is incremented

               Prefix increment
                var a = 1;
                var b = ++a;
                In this case a is 2 and b is 2 
                    because a is incremented by 1 (1+1=2) and then assigned to b.
    

          Comparison Operators

            == isEqual to 
            >= GreaterThan or Equal to 
            <= LessThan or Equal to 
            != NotEqual
            > GreaterThan
            < Lessthan

        Logical Operators - used in Boolean expressions

            ! Not
            && And
            || Or


        Assignment Operators

            = assignment a = 1
            += addition assignment a += 3, means a = a + 3
            -= subtraction assignment
            *= multiplication assignment
            /= division assignment
